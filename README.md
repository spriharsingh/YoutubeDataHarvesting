# YoutubeDataHarvesting
This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the YouTube API to extract information on a channel and query the required outputs.

# Steps Involved:

- Building a simple UI with Streamlit. This would allow users to enter the YouTube channel ID of the channel they want to analyze.
- Retrieving data from the YouTube API. The Streamlit app would use the YouTube API to extract information about the channel, such as the number of subscribers, views, and videos.
- Storing the data in a MongoDB database. This would allow the data to be easily queried and analyzed.
- Migrating the data to a SQL data warehouse. This would allow for more complex queries and analysis.
- Enable users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app. This would allow users to easily find the data they are looking for and to analyze it in different ways.

# Applications Used

- Streamlit: A Python library for building web applications.
- Google API: The YouTube API, which allows developers to access data about YouTube channels.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data.
- SQL: A relational database language that is used to query and analyze data.

The project is a great way to learn about these technologies and to build a valuable tool for analyzing YouTube channel data.
